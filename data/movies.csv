A Californian native, she wrote her first review in 1953 and joined ‘The New Yorker’ in 1968. Praised for her highly opinionated and feisty writing style and criticised for her subjective and sometimes ruthless reviews, Kael’s writing was refreshingly and intensely rooted in her experience of watching a film as a member of the audience. Loved and hated in equal measure – loved by other critics for whom she was immensely influential, and hated by filmmakers whose films she trashed - Kael destroyed films that have since become classics such as The Sound of Music and raved about others such as Bonnie and Clyde. She was also aware of the perennial difficulties for women working in the movies and in film criticism, and fiercely fought sexism, both in her reviews and in her media appearances.",0,210,"U/A","http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185//4vwsZj1Seu5jSbdQwsimgWBjz6s.jpg","http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w780/null",100

Under Andrei Șerban’s direction, gone are the stereotypes; instead, a production that shadows the tumults and shameful fears that drive humanity exposed here in all its fragility.",0,160,"U/A","http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185//uLI9uu2bJCMtwX4hLzW6feHQv4b.jpg","http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w780//nllrAVsX5bH2Z93xRpzqQFNjgrt.jpg",150

Such was the audacious challenge Gaël Lépingle set himself – to paint a picture in period cinema of the French middle classes: so great in number and yet so rarely depicted on the silver screen. After La Prisonnière du Pont-aux-Dions and Julien, a coming-of-age story about a teenager in la Beauce, the film-maker continues his exploration of the French provinces. The setting: a village in the Tarn region in summer. The protagonists: the villagers. The story, however, is more hectic, the plot wending its way in vibrant colours through familiar territory – The Three Musketeers. In this musical, Dumas’ celebrated characters – the musketeers, the queen, Richelieu, etc., swoon in living rooms with TVs on garish sofas, talk in the wistful quiet of the pedestrianized streets with ready-made ruins laid on, debate in the pharmacy, party in the miserably dingy village halls, their words sung in an attempt to contaminate the bleak surroundings.",0,151,"U/A","http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185//8UWG3ndw8jFlch3mku5YrDcB1ps.jpg","http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w780/null",54

487463,"The Ancient Woods","A poetic and atypical nature film about the various inhabitants of an old-growth forest, on the ground, in the air and in the water. There's no commentary, only the rich, almost palpable sounds of the forest and the magical situations captured by the camera. Although we might sometimes be puzzled as to what's actually happening—a mating ritual or the start of a fight?—the lack of explanation leaves space for us to associate freely and simply experience the images. The film offers a close-up view of a wide range of creatures—such as the insect that appears out of the melting snow, gradually begins to move and impatiently waits until all its legs are free so it can fly away. The scale of the portraits is sometimes grand and at other times modest, but always filmed with precision, whether in daylight or at night.
